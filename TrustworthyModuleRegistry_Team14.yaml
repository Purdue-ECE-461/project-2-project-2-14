      1. The obtained token should be provided to the other endpoints via the "X-Authorization" header.
      2. The "Authorization" header is *required* in your system.

      Otherwise, this endpoint should return HTTP 501 "Not implemented", and the "X-Authorization" header should be unused for the other endpoints.
